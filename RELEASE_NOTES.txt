 Release notes for Numexpr 1.3
===============================


Changes from 1.2 to 1.3
=======================

- A new type called internally `float` has been implemented so as to
  be able to work natively with single-precision floating points.
  This prevents the silent upcast to `double` types that was taking
  place in previous versions, so allowing both an improved performance
  and an optimal usage of memory for the single-precision
  computations.  However, the casting rules for floating point types
  slightly differs from those of NumPy.  See:

      http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/wiki/Overview

  or the README.txt file for more info on this issue.

- Support for Python 2.6 added.

- When linking with the MKL, added a '-rpath' option to the link step
  so that the paths to MKL libraries are automatically included into
  the runtime library search path of the final package (i.e. the user
  won't need to update its LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_RUN_PATH environment
  variables anymore).  Fixes #16.


Changes from 1.1.1 to 1.2
=========================

- Support for Intel's VML (Vector Math Library) added, normally
  included in Intel's MKL (Math Kernel Library).  In addition, when
  the VML support is on, several processors can be used in parallel
  (see the new `set_vml_num_threads()` function).  With that, the
  computations of transcendental functions can be accelerated quite a
  few.  For example, typical speed-ups when using one single core for
  contiguous arrays are 3x with peaks of 7.5x (for the pow() function).
  When using 2 cores the speed-ups are around 4x and 14x respectively.
  Closes #9.

- Some new VML-related functions have been added:

  * set_vml_accuracy_mode(mode):  Set the accuracy for VML operations.

  * set_vml_num_threads(nthreads): Suggests a maximum number of
    threads to be used in VML operations.

  * get_vml_version():  Get the VML/MKL library version.

  See the README.txt for more info about them.

- In order to easily allow the detection of the MKL, the setup.py has
  been updated to use the numpy.distutils.  So, if you are already
  used to link NumPy/SciPy with MKL, then you will find that giving
  VML support to numexpr works almost the same.

- A new `print_versions()` function has been made available.  This
  allows to quickly print the versions on which numexpr is based on.
  Very handy for issue reporting purposes.

- The `numexpr.numexpr` compiler function has been renamed to
  `numexpr.NumExpr` in order to avoid name collisions with the name of
  the package (!).  This function is mainly for internal use, so you
  should not need to upgrade your existing numexpr scripts.


Changes from 1.1 to 1.1.1
=========================

- The case for multidimensional array operands is properly accelerated
  now.  Added a new benchmark (based on a script provided by Andrew
  Collette, thanks!) for easily testing this case in the future.
  Closes #12.

- Added a fix to avoid the caches in numexpr to grow too much.  The
  dictionary caches are kept now always with less than 256 entries.
  Closes #11.

- The VERSION file is correctly copied now (it was not present for the
  1.1 tar file, I don't know exactly why).  Closes #8.


Changes from 1.0 to 1.1
=======================

- Numexpr can work now in threaded environments.  Fixes #2.

- The test suite can be run programmatically by using
  ``numexpr.test()``.

- Support a more complete set of functions for expressions (including
  those that are not supported by MSVC 7.1 compiler, like the inverse
  hyperbolic or log1p and expm1 functions.  The complete list now is:

    * where(bool, number1, number2): number
        Number1 if the bool condition is true, number2 otherwise.
    * {sin,cos,tan}(float|complex): float|complex
        Trigonometric sinus, cosinus or tangent.
    * {arcsin,arccos,arctan}(float|complex): float|complex
        Trigonometric inverse sinus, cosinus or tangent.
    * arctan2(float1, float2): float
        Trigonometric inverse tangent of float1/float2.
    * {sinh,cosh,tanh}(float|complex): float|complex
        Hyperbolic sinus, cosinus or tangent.
    * {arcsinh,arccosh,arctanh}(float|complex): float|complex
        Hyperbolic inverse sinus, cosinus or tangent.
    * {log,log10,log1p}(float|complex): float|complex
        Natural, base-10 and log(1+x) logarithms.
    * {exp,expm1}(float|complex): float|complex
        Exponential and exponential minus one.
    * sqrt(float|complex): float|complex
        Square root.
    * {real,imag}(complex): float
        Real or imaginary part of complex.
    * complex(float, float): complex
        Complex from real and imaginary parts.
