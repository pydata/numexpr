Announcing NumExpr 2.14.1
=========================

Hi everyone,

NumExpr 2.14.1 introduces patches to ensure compatibility with NumPy 1.26,
rolling back static typing support.

Project documentation is available at:

https://numexpr.readthedocs.io/

Changes from 2.14.0 to 2.14.1
-----------------------------

* Rolled back static typing support to ensure compatibiity with NumPy 1.26.
* Added CI tests for NumPy 1.26

What's Numexpr?
---------------

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

It has multi-threaded capabilities, as well as support for Intel's
MKL (Math Kernel Library), which allows an extremely fast evaluation
of transcendental functions (sin, cos, tan, exp, log...) while
squeezing the last drop of performance out of your multi-core
processors.  Look here for a some benchmarks of numexpr using MKL:

https://github.com/pydata/numexpr/wiki/NumexprMKL

Its only dependency is NumPy (MKL is optional), so it works well as an
easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use, computational engine for projects that
don't want to adopt other solutions requiring more heavy dependencies.

Where I can find Numexpr?
-------------------------

The project is hosted at GitHub in:
