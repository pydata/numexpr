=========================
 Announcing Numexpr 2.4.3
=========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

It wears multi-threaded capabilities, as well as support for Intel's
MKL (Math Kernel Library), which allows an extremely fast evaluation
of transcendental functions (sin, cos, tan, exp, log...)  while
squeezing the last drop of performance out of your multi-core
processors.  Look here for a some benchmarks of numexpr using MKL:

Its only dependency is NumPy (MKL is optional), so it works well as an
easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use, computational engine for projects that
don't want to adopt other solutions requiring more heavy dependencies.

What's new
==========

This is a maintenance release to cope with an old bug affecting
comparisons with empty strings.  Fixes #121 and PyTables #184.

In case you want to know more in detail what has changed in this
version, see:

https://github.com/pydata/numexpr/wiki/Release-Notes

or have a look at RELEASE_NOTES.txt in the tarball.

Where I can find Numexpr?
=========================

The project is hosted at GitHub in:

https://github.com/pydata/numexpr

You can get the packages from PyPI as well (but not for RC releases):

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/numexpr
