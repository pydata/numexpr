Following are notes useful for releasing Numexpr.

Preliminaries
-------------

- Make sure that ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt`` and ``ANNOUNCE.txt`` are up to
  date with the latest news in the release.

- Remove the `.devN` suffix in ``numexpr/version.py``.

- Do a commit and a push:

  $ git commit -a -m"Getting ready for release X.Y.Z"

Testing
-------

- Run the test suite in different platforms (at least Linux and
  Windows) and make sure that all tests passes.

- Re-compile with MKL support and see if all tests passes as well.

- Run all the benchmarks in ``bench/`` directory and see if the
  speed-ups are the expected ones.

Packaging
---------

- Make the tarball with the command:

  $ python setup.py sdist

  Do a quick check that the tarball is sane.

Releasing
---------

- Create a tag ``vX.Y.Z`` from ``master``.  Use the next message:

  $ git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Tagging version X.Y.Z"

- Push the tag to the github repo:

  $ git push
  $ git push --tags

Uploading
---------

- Upload it in the PyPi repository:

  $ python setup.py sdist upload

Announcing
----------

- Send an announcement to the NumPy list and python-announce list.
  Use the ``ANNOUNCE.rst`` file as skeleton (or possibly as the
  definitive version).


Post-release actions
--------------------

- Edit ``numexpr/version.py`` to bump the version revision
  (i.e. X.Y.Z --> X.Y.(Z+1).dev0).

- Create new headers for adding new features in ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt``
  and empty the release-specific information in ``ANNOUNCE.txt`` and
  add this place-holder instead:

  #XXX version-specific blurb XXX#

  Don't forget to update header to the next version in those files.

- Commit your changes:

  $ git commit -a -m"Post X.Y.Z release actions done"
  $ git push


That's all folks!
