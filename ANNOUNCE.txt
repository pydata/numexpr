========================
 Announcing Numexpr 2.0
========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

It wears multi-threaded capabilities, as well as support for Intel's
VML library, which allows for squeezing the last drop of performance
out of your multi-core processors.
