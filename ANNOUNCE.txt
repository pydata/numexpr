==========================
 Announcing Numexpr 1.3.1
==========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

This is a maintenance release.  On it, support for the `unit32` type
has been added (it is internally upcasted to 'int64'), and a new
`abs()` function has been added (thanks to Pauli Virtanen for the
patch).

Also, a little tweaking in the treatment of unaligned arrays on Intel
architectures allows for up to 2x speedups in computations involving
unaligned arrays.  For example, in the included
``unaligned-simple.py`` benchmark, the output before the tweaking was:

NumPy aligned:      0.63 s
NumPy unaligned:    1.66 s
Numexpr aligned:    0.65 s
Numexpr unaligned:  1.09 s

while now it is:

NumPy aligned:      0.63 s
NumPy unaligned:    1.65 s
Numexpr aligned:    0.65 s
Numexpr unaligned:  0.57 s   <-- almost 2x faster than above

where you can see how the unaligned case can be even faster than the
aligned one.  And no, there is no black magic going on here; it is
just that, the 'aligned' array was actually a strided one, and the
total working datasize was a bit larger for this case.

In case you want to know more in detail what has changed in this
version, see:
